# Counseling4Addiction

Counseling4Addiction is a web-based platform dedicated to supporting individuals struggling with addiction by providing personalized counseling services.
The platform allows users to submit their personal details for receiving guidance and support, while maintaining a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a simple web interface where users can:
- View available counseling services.
- Submit their personal information for counseling.
- Store user information securely in the backend (to be developed).

This project serves as an initial prototype for a more comprehensive counseling platform.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Form:** A form where users can enter their personal details including name, email, contact number, and preferred counseling service.
- **Data Storage:** Data entered by users can be stored (to be implemented with a database backend).
- **Responsive Design:** The platform is designed to be accessible and user-friendly on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS3:** Styling the interface, ensuring a responsive and modern layout.
- **JavaScript:** Basic form validations.
- **PHP :** For handling form submissions and potential back-end data storage (can be extended as needed).
- **MySQL (optional):** For storing user-submitted data (to be integrated).

## Pages in the Project

### 1. Home Page (`index.html`)
The main entry point of the platform. Users can find information about counseling services and a button leading to the form page.

### 2. Form Page (`form.php`)
A page containing a form where users can fill in their details and request counseling support. This form includes the following fields:
- Name
- Email
- Contact Number
- Preferred Counseling Service

Once the form is submitted, the data will be processed (future backend integration with PHP/MySQL).
